# Course Registration System

A comprehensive course registration system developed across multiple iterations, transitioning from Java to Python implementation.

## Project Overview

This project implements a university course registration system with the following key features:

- Student course registration and management
- Advisor approval workflow
- Course prerequisite checking
- Transcript management
- Waitlist handling for full courses
- JSON-based data persistence

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main iterations:

### Iteration 1 (Java)

- Initial implementation in Java
- Core functionality including:
  - Basic course registration
  - Student management
  - Advisor approval system
  - Unit tests

### Iteration 2 (Java)

- Enhanced Java implementation
- Additional features:
  - Improved course section handling
  - Expanded course properties
  - Better capacity management

### Iteration 3 (Python)

- Complete Python reimplementation
- Modified architecture with:
  - `CourseRegistrationSystem.py`
  - `Course.py`
  - `Advisor.py`
  - `CourseSection.py`

## Key Features

- Course management with properties like:
  - Course ID and name
  - Credits
  - Prerequisites
  - Weekly schedule
  - Enrollment capacity
  - Instructor assignment
- Student transcript tracking
- JSON-based data storage and retrieval
- Comprehensive unit testing

## Development Process

The project follows an iterative development approach with multiple iterations, each building upon the previous one and introducing new features and improvements.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Iterations 1 & 2)
- Python (Iteration 3)
- JSON for data persistence
- JUnit for testing (Java iterations)

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each iteration is available in the respective PDF files:

- Design Class Diagram (DCD)
- Detailed Design Document (DSD)
- Requirements Analysis Document (RAD)
